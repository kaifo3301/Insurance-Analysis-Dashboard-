# 🚀 Insurance Claims & Premium Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard analyzes insurance policies, premiums, and claims over multiple years to uncover key business insights.  
It provides a comprehensive view of policy distribution, premium-to-claim ratios, customer segments, and risk factors for better decision-making.  


## 🎯 Objectives

- Track policies, premiums, and claims over time.  
- Measure premium-to-claim ratio to identify profitability risks.  
- Analyze policy distribution by vehicle type and customer demographics.  
- Identify high-claim vs. high-premium segments for pricing optimization.  
- Compare year-over-year claim patterns across usage categories.  


## 📊 Business Outcomes

- Policies Open: 508K  
- Total Premium:$4bn  
- Total Claims: $9bn  
- Premium-to-Claim Ratio: 44%  
- Average Premium:$8K | Average Claim: $18K  
- Claim Count: 38K  


## 🔑 Key Insights

- Motorcycles (106K policies) lead in policy adoption.  
- Agricultural vehicles (farm-related usage) generate disproportionately high claims.  
- Gender analysis reveals distinct claim behavior patterns.  
- Premium vs. Claims scatter plot highlights high-risk outliers needing actuarial attention.  
- Claim ratios vary significantly across categories (e.g., Taxis and Agricultural Own Farm show very high loss ratios).  



## 🚀 Feature Improvements and Recommendations

- Risk-Based Pricing: Adjust premium rates for categories with consistently high claim ratios.  
- Customer Segmentation: Develop targeted policies for low-risk segments to improve profitability.  
- Fraud Detection & Monitoring: Focus on outlier claim patterns flagged in the scatter plot.  
-Product Redesign: Introduce tailored insurance products for high-risk categories (e.g., agricultural vehicles, taxis).  
- Claims Management: Strengthen processes to reduce loss severity in segments with repeated high claims.
